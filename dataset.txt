I don’t think there is an objectively correct answer here.
At the end of the day, people will still use what they want even if you change it or not.
Like I support the change because we will still use the old system and it’ll be easier for us to communicate with our allies and anyone we introduce to the game
Please provide objective evidence or don’t reply
While upper staff have sit by for months with the server in stagnation, is unacceptable.
I don’t want power either. I want the people who are in power to get their heads out of their asses.
If you ban me, I will keep doing it if I do choose. You don’t control me. Even if I am banned, I can still DM advertise.
Congrats, once again you won’t have fixed the problem and you’re proving my point that you’re too socially inept to be an owner.
I will be. Peter obviously doesn’t appreciate the work we’ve all been doing for the server so imo it’s justified.
Oh no! The space servers that have been nothing but discords for over a year don’t like us! 😞
Considering we went and checked out the server and had a 30 minute conversation with the owner, read your words again.
@Astralchroma You can ban me, but I can promise you that you couldn’t stop me from DM advertising if I wanted to.
You think the server will grow off of this? It won’t.
Complaining is great. Has no actual plan or timetable for growth for the server.
Server playerbase has increased significantly from us DM advertising.
Just not true lmao
That is an objective fact.
Oh no! The other dead space servers are upset that our server isn’t dead 
Mfw you are literally a discord lurker and there are new players who have been playing the server.
Poor reputation among what, two other space discord servers? One of which literally stole hundreds of dollars of donations with false promises?
It’s not. The server was dead and dying before we started working on it.
If you’d rather get caught up in moral ambiguity than the progress we’re making in the server, be my guest.
You’ve quit like 6 times and yet you’re here. You should stay instead of leaving.
Just stop talking about it. You guys aren’t convincing us, we aren’t convincing you. I am firm in our resolve and belief that we can help the server, and we will continue to do so.
Ah yes, us building a new spawn, tutorial, starter videos, isnt helping.
How? If everyone would quit because of us?
And the basis for this is?
Please tell me how, in the past two months, we have attributed to this?
Objective facts and specifics of how "we are the reason the server was dying"
You aren't giving objective reasoning behind your claim.
In the past two months, what specific things or objective things have we done that has "killed the server"
Criticism does not mean we want to drive him off.
Us wanting Peter to you know, do things for the server, is not driving him off.
ItsAlreadyGold, not the things that are necessary to keep the server alive or growing.
And this is growing the server, how?
This is a trivial object.. please Peter
Is waterfall objectively worse than velocity
Lmao
I mean the truth is objective so it doesn’t really matter what he believes lol
You can sit here and talk all day long but until you start sinking some ships all you’re doing is talking
Fodder mindset
You should learn to cope with the losses now because they’re gonna keep coming
Attacking our member who is mining lmao
Like what is your logic
You gank one of our members, fail, and expect us to not attack you?
Waaaah waaaah! No honor!
Low on totem pole imo
I mean its worked great, we have a whole fleet of your nations sunk ships
“Why no politics on server 😡”
I meant you guys just donating us ships and gear
No. You are dodging whenever I am putting your hypothesis to the test
You saying “agree with me” whenever this is an objective situation that I can prove in game lmfao
This is not a subjective matter
No lol, 8ks and 12ks don’t need to be a trump card against all ships
Bullshit sorry lmfao
He does
Ain’t gone happen ma boy
That’s unbalanced as fuck
They’re too hard to hit mongrel
Rattlyy you literally are just talking out of your ass for the fun of it
I have told you so many times how good they are
Even shown you how to use them
And you don’t listen to me
just stop talking lmao
Melkron then it’s a skill issue
Not a balancing issue
You don’t know what you’re talking about I’m sorry
I can kill SFs in 4ks
If you want a proof of concept all you have to do is log on
You literally said that
What
You DONT USE THE COUNTER
Skill issue not my fuckin problem
Until you use Gunships vs SFs imo you have no right to complain sorry
One side is objective one side is subjective 🤭
It is objective that in the balancing Gunships are designed to counter starfighters. Your nation has never once used a gunship to counter starfighters.
Even considering that, we have all been pushing for a size nerf for over a month
Lots of coping
Because you refuse to listen
why should I listen to a wall that only vomits bullshit
He’s upset that our argument has objective reasoning behind it
I have no power lol
How? Please explain to me how gunships are not made to counter SFs. That 4ks are unable to kill SFs, and that you guys don’t use them so you really can’t say it’s not true? 
Have you ever considered a skill issue Rattlyy
But you could’ve focused out the fighters?
Almost like… fleet composition matters??????
It isn’t
Depends on what the enemy brings
He saw tonight killer
That’s it lmfao
How is that a balancing issue?
Legitimate question fell
You can
I do it all the time
I think if we make them 350+ fell it’ll make 4ks better at fighting them
We also want dc back for big ships but the lag is the question
Again fell ask yourself if that’s a balancing issue
Idk which one of you said that fleet composition does not matter but I just wanted to point out that you’re mistaken
No lol
Effective gunship counters SF
ATs doing DMG is insanely OP
Who were the pilots for both sides of the fight earlier
Not you but your side
Do you see how it could’ve been beneficial
Like do you understand the concept
Point of the story is if you brought a gunship that fight could’ve gone differently
Or we could just not as it’s wasted dev time and objectively worse from a shielding and hull design standpoint
And thus you describe perfectly how this would be a worthless add from release.
Shield regen is fine you just don’t use power mode effectively
1v1 space arena is a poor test for balancing and doesn’t happen in survival
Regen is balanced fine. We are adding even more ways for Gunships to kill SFs which is basically the only balancing issue we’ve had
Regardless the idea is to change how automatic weapons do the majority of your damage
It’s not entirely, that was a poor choice of words, majority
Fun is subjective so I can’t tell you otherwise
Objectively the combat system is balanced with specific ships doing one thing better than another so it makes sense to bring it to a fight. The goal is to make combat more engaging and less based on movement alone
Him misunderstanding combat
Which is no fault of his own; he didn’t really have anyone telling him and there’s no source material
Combat is balanced around team fights because 1v1s basically do not happen in survival
What you just said would make team fights last sub 5 minutes
That’s a horrible change lol
This ain’t that server
TTK right now is fine if you use the tools available to you
If a ship is cruising away. Pulse your gravwell and light it up
Ship design meta is largely based on how you place your shields and the blocks within them
As in making your ship good enough to lose a shield or two and still operate
They’re used in basically every fleet battle
A change we want to add that’ll make capital ships more widely used is re-adding DC to them
DC movement is infinitely better than cruising
Again, in Capital ships your phasers and heavy weapons do the majority of the damage
You’re complaining about movement being the same?
Yes, we know that the barrier to entry for noobs is a steep curve right now
I don’t think you’ve “mastered” a single ship class or even come close melkron lol
I mean I’ve been playing for about 5 years, I’d say yes
Don’t say it’s “boring to play after you’ve mastered the class” if you haven’t mastered the class
It’s up to you to decide if it’s boring or not. It is not unbalanced though. Using every tool you have available to you in survival during a team fight is how you get kills.
You can still get kills in survival without using every tool available, I’m not sure what your point is here
Slyv was SvSing yesterday
Also the server is doing great for itself rn. We’re peaking at like mid 20s on weekends, and we are working on a massive update that should create more risk and induce more combat
All of them  are active and you can check that by /n info in game lol
Yes, that’s the goal
(Rn basically everyone uses 4k miners)
So that there is reason to use the larger ships for mining
We are also adding a new way to mine in space
The anti SF weapon we’re adding will make gunships be more important in the meta
They can, just not effectively
??? @Melkron A 2k is faster than a 4K
Why would we remove them?
The idea is to make auto damage be less consistent and add an alternative method with aiming
It is about position because your turrrets hit more accurately at some angles than others based on how you build your ship
Lower skill players would basically never have a single chance in combat ever
We’re not removing /st, that would make the skill gap ridiculously large
That would make Vega 10x stronger than what it is now
This is essentially how old SL was in a way
@Melkron in the current system without ST will take literal hours melkron
Removing /st will widen the skill gap
I’m not sure I understand what you’re suggesting
@Melkron And adding spam clicking your LMB will fix these issues? No
Sodium is objectively better than optifine
You can just get OkZoomer
With sodium
Which is also objectively better
Skillbo if you make your speeder correctly then that’s just objectively incorrect lol
They were OP on planets with OSTs
Reminder to vote y’all
TL:DR I don’t really care what you think is unfair and above is the objective reasoning behind it
My playtime and how often I play the server is irrelevant in discussing how much a tax should be, the reasoning I am using is objective and based on the time it takes to complete tasks in game to achieve x amount of money.
It is not unreasonable to increase the tax over time as new money making methods exist and more money enters the economy.
Completely and objectively wrong
Longy this isn’t even a bad argument
How, elaborate
Because that’s just complete bs
There won’t be a mode where you can toggle pvp.
I think the server is big enough to the point where we could maybe look in to expanding noob prot time
Because TopTrash hasn’t camped anyone
Please explain what your definition of camping is
There are rules against this which are enforced
Nobody is getting “camped”, noobs aren’t getting slaughtered, and combat is not prevalent.
Rattlyy you’re living in a dream world and trying to push an agenda with a false narrative.
There’s no ruler of HE
This would’ve been valid maybe 6 months ago
I attacked both of them
I can attack players for whatever I want, the attacks on Sylvia happen sparsely at best and it’s whenever I take a break from helping out on the server to actually play the game
You CAN progress in the game easily without getting slaughtered. It is insanely hard to get pirated 
Then stop bringing it up as a fact
Rattlyy, we aren’t doing that.
We literally already committed ourselves to defending the new areas from pirates.
Again this doesn’t happen
Don’t say things like that if you are not willing to provide examples
New players don’t really die or interact with “tryhards”
48 hours of game time before that’s even possible lol
So the complaint is valid in the sense of new players not really understanding mechanics and how to effectively escape
Being pirated is part of gameplay. To work to help newer players understand pirates and how to escape, we need source material to  teach new players.
In terms of playerbase, we are doing basically the best we ever have (excluding launch) and you can track our progress on the tracker.
@_Longy We know, and are working diligently to support this
In terms of playerbase, we are doing basically the best we ever have (excluding launch) and you can track our progress on the tracker.
I’m glad you like CCNet, but this ain’t there.
@WitherV Care to chime in?
CCNet is a cracked server that appeals to a wide variety of people (Geopol), very few people play there for the movecraft.
We peaked at 31 last Sunday
Actually, our tracker that shows playercount online completely disproves you
The reason the server has 8 online is because it’s the middle of the day on a Weekday
The level grind and money making grind is being addressed in the update
Just be patient
This is being remedied with the frontier update
A valid complaint is that there is no source material for new players or learn about piracy, so along with frontier update I’ll work on creating more videos to help explain
None of us trade so this is a irrelevant point
Noobs cannot be killed
If you willingly cargo trade while a pirate is sitting out in space? Likely you will die
So avoid dying It’s insanely easy
So avoid dying
It’s insanely easy
Rattlyy complaining about combat existing?
What’s the argument about today
Bring an escort
Then stop bringing it up as a fact
I attacked both of them
This would’ve been valid maybe 6 months ago
Rattlyy you’re living in a dream world and trying to push an agenda with a false narrative.
Nobody is getting “camped”, noobs aren’t getting slaughtered, and combat is not prevalent.
There are rules against this which are enforced
Please explain what your definition of camping is
How, elaborate
Because that’s just complete bs
Completely and objectively wrong
You can be attacked while doing these things, and that is a good gameplay mechanic.
You should not be able to just passively do all of those things. There should be an inherent risk
This already exists in the form of noob protection.
Also Brooklyn is entirely correct. Look at the minuscule amount of kills in survival over the past month. Then look at the even smaller amount of people who were “newer” players that were killed and you see that everything you’re trying to push is objectively false.
You’re acting as though there is an epidemic of noob slaughtering and piracy
When in reality it is entirely sparse at best
I've planned an entire vacation in the time you've all been arguing
we can cross that bridge when we get there
Realistically it would be great if this conversation just ended because it’s pointless
Rattlyy is arguing over things that literally do not exist
One of the opinions here is objective lol
mine? definitely thanks
Ah yeah the opinion with no facts behind it… very objective
New peak yesterday, previous peak Sunday, previous peak a week ago
Server been on constant playerbase growth since early February
What do you think this shows?
This is todays graph
Ah yeah a server with an exponential amount of exposure, playerbase, and devs
What a great comparison
Also cracked
No clue, I don’t play CCNet
Because rattlyy brings it up
The only legitimate complaint with any validity that you have @Rattlyy is that it’s too hard for noobs to learn how to escape piracy. We’ll work on it
No. Objectively your argument is incorrect. Noob killing is not prevalent, PIRACY is basically barely prevalent, it is easy to progress and not die, and the server has been consistently growing since February 26th.
If you feel otherwise about any of this please make a suggestion in ⁠feedback-and-ideas or make a player report ticket. @Rattlyy
Trainboy’s argument is also really valid
I will compile all of the data that shows you are literally bending over and talking out of your ass whenever I get off work today.
please do that
If you’d like to contribute it would be great to work on some frontier update stuff
lmao
this server should keep making my ego bigger
Gutin is kinda carrying the load by himself
@Sciath Don’t waste your time, it doesn’t matter
He’s arguing for the sake of arguing, just stay focused on the update
It’s just rattlyy
If you have a suggestion for the improvement of the server, fill out the feedback form, or in ⁠feedback-and-ideas
If you have an issue with a player please make a player report ticket.
The only people who can see those tickets are Moderators and Directors
Good looking dude
Awful pic lol
Reddit gave me a phone call at work today about our ad campaign lol
Looks goof
Probably looks better in game
Objectively my ego should be grown to compete with my only true nemesis, my ego
Because we just used the original shape and made it our own thing
The only thing objective here is Eden is not risky enough to warrant it's proximity to the best resources. The solution to this; Make Eden more risky and add a 1 way gate from Sirius -> Trench so that other planets have a similar proximity (with a tradeoff of less risk)
You just want us to be biased so you can complain
Every argument you present is grasping at straws
Also we already committed to defending the new areas from piracy lmfao
Rattlyy wants the server to have no risk Sciath don't waste your time
It’s obvious you’re just trolling and have a hatred for us
Going near our base?
Stop lying
Nobody said that
You have no clue how wardens are and how it is to live there, we are not going to just have an empty system lol
You’ve literally never lived there
The logic behind it
this is not a “Vega decision”, Aury and the others who were in the development chat at the time all agreed on Eden’s placement
Exploit????
Unreal
It’s also a nice planet.
Defending yourself m
Counter attacking us
Because we are a good nation is not a balancing issue lmfao
There is NOTHING stopping you from moving in, setting up BDPs, base defense
My enemies can live there
as you said yourself, any of you that isn't my enemy can live there
Regardless to say “oh it’s bias that Eden is available to resources because Vega lives there” is really stupid. Any of you can live there
My point would include this^^
Should’ve prefaced
It’s risky to live there. A solution we could add is a 1 way from Sirius to trench
We don’t camp anyone just stfu
but it turned into NUUU RATTLY BIAS!!!! PLEASE GUTIN BAN HIM!!!!
Stop lying about what happens on the server
its really fucking hilarious
Rattlyy thinks that it’s OP that Vega lives on Eden and is mad that he would get attacked for moving there
We know he either thinks he himself is wrong, or that he knows his hatred is unfounded. That much is clear. He has answered the question
Genuinely would love to know
Rattlyy is just here to argue and act like Vega is this evil force of bias yadda yadda bullshit same old same old argument with zero facts behind it
All I’ve seen is cope so far that Vega is good at the game.
You can easily setup base defense at your base, (you wonder why we don’t attack Arimfea at Vask), and I also suggested making mob defenders not work/less effective on Eden.
as open as a plane door in mid air
this is true, van came with the compromise that maybe having eden in horizon with mob defenders is possibly too advantages, and suggested disabling them
me and vand are open minded here, the floor is open to you to leave down any point you want
But you either must think your points arent strong enough, which would make you wrong. Or you refuse to not hate Vega
You see that's just using an exact arguement I used with you, but the point here to make, is you dont think you will change your answer, because you hate vega so much
Its 1 question
Not an arguement
It doesnt need to turn into an arguementas I said
answering is pointless
you will never change your opinion
I will never change mine
the only thing that won't change is Elo's facts
why should I even bother answering, to argue even more? It's pointless
😠 also tbf lots of vegans and vega-tangent individuals either code or give numbers
How could we code the server
I used an AI to find the most possible answer
@Sciath 5 bucks to your pocket
that's evading the question
I won't even bother answering, this whole conversation is pointless, we will never change each other's opinions
Elo stated facts
He’s going to pull out a list of things that do not happen on HE and say that we do them
na give him time, let him prove his bias
Rattlyy, why do you hate us so much?
(he can’t because he’s biased)
Answer the question
That's a shit defflection
The topic at hand seems to be hating Vega
so why do you hate us so much
don't change the topic 
Why do you think we're just such a force of evil
defend your base or die
What’s hilarious is you genuinely thinking that attacking you is = attacking you til you quit
Rattlyy, I wonder why do you hate Vega so much?
Who complained @Astralchroma ?
Just because we will attack you does not mean you cannot live there" -> you can live here, but we will attack you until you quit the server or move out 
come live here, we will just camp you till you quit!
Please read what I wrote
Now read what you wroteH
How the fuck are you twisting my words this badly lmfao
You guys camped us 💀
The only people who have been camped on Eden was Vega
Maybe like a year ago that would’ve happened
Things that don’t happen on HE part 99999 of you saying this
There is nothing stopping anyone
You could live there
Just because we will attack you does not mean you cannot live there
It’s pretty easy to make base defenses
which translates to "you can all use my advantage except my enemies"
Waaah waaah Vega said they’d kill me if I went near their base
Like what do you expect lol
We’re enemies but not at war
Just Arcturan
Just because Vega lives there is not a balancing issue sorry
Defend your base
I mean we would likely attack you because we’re at war?
I love having hot gay sex
Also there is nothing stopping people from living on Eden
I guess he missed the part where every ore will be available in every system lmfao
lmfao
lmao
lol
lmfao im laughing my balls off
What are you even talking about
what elo said
How will people have to triple their resources to mine?
the whole idea of a planet being able to reach everything when everyone needs to triple their chet to travel is bs IMO 
Doesn’t really matter we were planning on making a new base soon
Definitely would make it harder to live there
I don’t think it’s the worst idea
As you can make wardens basically a non factor with mob defenders
do you not see how OP it would be to have space stations in any of the 3 new systems?
you disabled space stations to prevent oblivion 
Oh yeah I lives on that planet
The idiots made this update
Vega made the update
Vega lives on that planet
What if we disabled mob defenders on Eden
The devs are the ones that live on that planet
Things that don’t happen on HE 101
AU will be filled with shipwrecks that have resources and loot chests
These loot chests will contain things like credits, rare items, armor, etc
TBD if they will, there’s some issues regarding that and balancing
If you make it so there are station sieges in horizon, it instantly becomes the most valuable station in the game as you can instantly jump from your land to the most dangerous gates when someone is in hyper
They will still exist on the fringes of systems
Both
Systems will be somewhat large still.
Along with mining lasers in early April or late March
Each system is compartmentalized
Yes
do you not see how OP it would be to have space stations in any of the 3 new systems?
I don’t think it’s the worst idea
There is nothing else that needs to be argued.
No. Removes risk from trench
and lets you camp whoever goes near you
We've shown you the logic, and facts behind our reasoning, you dont refer to it, instead you spout more illogical arguements, that we beat down, so you spout more.
Then you personally attack you. This is not an arguement, its you grasping at the straws to claim we're biased
To claim we want to switch everything to our advantage
here's my answer to your question "why do you hate vega": you are decent people with skills, you already win everything, but you need to fullfill your narcisistic desires by making it impossible for anyone to go against you
you harassed everyone that was against you off the server
We have done nothing and will do nothing that fulfills the end part of that sentence.
We haven't harassed anyone 
I never made anyone cry? What are you talking about
how did you nerf yourself
????????????????????????????????????????????
if you convince vandrayk that he's wrong i'll come
i still haven't seen a valid argument to why forcing everyone to be exposed to my camping isint a great idea
its hilarious
Again, the solution will be to make Eden more risky and add a 1 way gate to Sirius to add a new gate to Trench so that it's harder to camp the entry for anyone who is a pirate. Trench is supposed to be incredibly dangerous as a tradeoff for the amount of resources available there.
We don't just randomly kill everyone
We are not a pirate nation
no you cant
sciath negative IQ moment
you forgot your own exploits
If you don't want to risk mining in the trench, feel free to mine in safer systems. Ilios will likely have better ores than the other 3 regular systems
-1 good boy points
Or.... fight us?????
It's war
The fuck are you talking about
@Melkron anyone can live on eden
it is not just us
we dont own the planet
This all circles back to rattlyy just coping that they're at war with us and they can't beat us lol
We've offerred to end the war several times
No. I said if you go near our base expect to die
Eden is 5kx5k
It's not about who's right or wrong, it doesn't matter if you admit defeat or not because you basically have no say 💀
We aren't going to "camp" anyone off of Eden
its hilarious
I still haven't heard a decent counter argument to mine
you keep circling on the same useless points that have been refuted multiple times
you say your points, they get refuted, say that i'm biased and I hate gay love, repeat 
If you are in arcturan, we will attack you because we are at war with you. 
TO COUNTER THIS,
you can make base defenses, or counter attack us.
i'm willing to take adderall to keep this going until i'm a fucking zombie
Then why would we attack you?
We aren't pirates
you own 80% of the server station
They cant agree with us
doesn't want to hear these facts
Because we can?
Which actively encourages combat, which encourages activity
It also reduces the supplyy, causing more fighting over pre-existing stations.
You guys are able to siege our stations
So your point here isint to convince anyone of your point, its to just get me tired enough to say yes?
The system will be balanced, this guy is just trying to make something that is a non issue an issue.
my point is that you're blatantly giving yourself an advantage and generating bullshit to keep ur exploit afloat 
The result of this argument will be to make Eden more risky, and to add a new entrance to the trench from Sirius
very true
The point being what?
Maybe a year ago, when the server first opened and we were a pirate nation we were too harsh on killing people and it caused a negative effect for the server. @K9_Caper
he keeps circling on the same counter arguments, that are all refuted, that don't make sense, that contradict themselves and keeps doing personal attacks on me
To fix that we stopped being pirates, started playing less, and developing the server more.
developing exploits for yourself
Right see, this is a nonissue because of the danger Eden poses to anyone living on it, making the risks of Eden worth the reward that could come of it. But neither is Vega a pirate nation, nor are we interested in pursuing Piracy. Again making this a nonissue
Eden rn is not dangerous enough
I think everyone agrees on that
you should move eden out of the horizon
and leave the horizon empty
To say that "harassment" and "camping" is prevalent on HE within the past 4-6 months is just flat out false
That can be rectified. So the issue you have is us pursuing piracy. Which we dont do
That's very true
But we no longer do that
And havent for like 10months
Ever since the damkoth blockade went, in july, we stopped.
no balls quit rn
the point of all of this is that my argument still stands
End of the argument is here. Eden will be made more risky and we’ll add another 1way gate in to trench from Sirius. Anyone can live on Eden, just because Vega lives there is not relevant to the discussion.
Vega is relevant lol 
Excellent, lets discuss later the dangers we can add to make it more imposing
It’s not useless. Makes it more difficult to camp the trench as there will be 3 entrances rather than 2
you should come help me I needs help
Server nations and politics won’t and shouldn’t dictate balancing changes 
true, vega is the only nation that can dictate balancing changes
by placing their base in the middle of every hyperspace travel 
Anytime balancing needs to be done it is thrown in staff chat #balancing
all of vega is staff
quite literally
and my points still stands
Do you guys love a backbreaking night with the guys? My ass hurts
TopTrash is the only staff member. Kwaze, Wither, Sciath, Myself, are helpers
And? We’re all unbiased
The combat system is balanced lmfao
And at the end of the day, Gutin/Aury have the final say on anything
Right all settled then?
Looks to be
we should end this by saying that eden should be moved out of Horizon
If we were so biased, why did we nerf starfighters? Why are we even entertaining trying to rectify the issues you pointed out in this post? Why is the frontier update addressing issues that were posted in the feedback form we sent out?
read this thread 
If the changes we make aren’t enough, we can revisit this.
There won’t be a 2 way
So it’s either add a 1 way or none at all
Ill do a three way if its another guy, 3 guys is better then 2 guys and a girl
If the risk we add isn’t enough, we’ll look into it
Considering it doesn’t exist yet you have no way to rectify this claim
If you want to go to the new systems, you should expect inherent danger
It doesn’t now and it shouldn’t ever
No, I am saying that Vega living on Eden is not relevant to its placement or this entire conversation lol
it is extremely relevant
Would be cool to add more planets that are super dangerous
If you’re at war with someone, and you’re stupid enough to risk going into the most dangerous system on the server, that’s on you
There’s no rule against attacking you.
There are rules against spam killing and camping, which can be enforced
no
yes
why
how
where
what
????
You're just wrong
You're a liar
Coco Cola is much better then pepsi
My opinion is fact
You're just a shit person
Well atleast I dont lose 4 frigates to a shuttle
I think you're gay
I hope you die
Siuccidati
Toptrash this guy said kys!
MODS BAN HIM HE'S BIASED
I hate HE
You're the worst people ive met
Objectively my arguement is stupid
You're just a stupid person
I dont think there's a single instance of you having intelligence
I think you make some fair points
My opinion is, you all suck.
I hope you find your special place in hell.
Im getting hired at Helix academy btw.
Who's joe btw?
Lol
Lmao
You're wrong
BRITISH SHIPS ARE BETTER THEN ITALIAN SHIPS
If you're so great, why is my ego larger then yours?
To quote Vandrayk "Most idiots come from the USA" You must be from Canada.
You dont even play
You're entire nation is made of staff.
You're just grasping at straws here.
My nation is cleary the one in the right here, we may of doxed your mother and your dog, but we still own 12 stations, therefore we must be right.
